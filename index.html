			"Each location in the backroom has a\ngrouping. This can be openstock, lower\ncasepack, or upper casepack.\nThe grouping determines how much\nproduct gets pulled in your Move batches.\nYou can group locations using Backroom\nLocation Management via myWork.",

			"Locations grouped as \"openstock\" will\nonly have you pull as much product is\nneeded.\nLocations grouped as \"casepack\" will\nhave you pull the amount marked on the\ncasepack for however many casepacks\nare needed.",

			"To drop a One for One batch, scan the\nproduct from the fillgroup you wish to pull,\nclick on EXF, then \"Fill \[fillgroup\]\" and\nselect One for One.\n\nOne for Ones will often replace autofills\nfor their fillgroup when dropped",

			"Auditing locations is a reliable way to\nimprove Backroom Location Accuracy.\n\nSimply load up the Audit app on your\nZebra, scan a backroom location, and\nscan product in said location to update\ncounts.",

			"When backstocking, make sure to pay\nattention to fillgroups. Each aisle in the\nbackroom has a designated fillgroup, or\ntwo, marked on the end of the aisle.\n\nOnly locate product from those fillgroups\nin their respective aisles.",

			"It's always a good idea to make sure the\npick label is facing outward when back-\nstocking casepacks.\n\nThe label with the product barcode can be\npeeled off for this reason, allowing\nyou to place it wherever convenient.",

			"About to clock out for the day? Try to\nspend a minute or two cleaning up the\narea around your aisle.\nKeeping the backroom clean not only\nmakes it easier to move around in, but\nhelps keep everyone safe from potential\nhazards.",

            "When pulling a product for a guest, make\nsure to take that product out of location\nwith myWork.\nJust scan the product, tap the name, hit\n\"Take\", and scan one of the locations\nlisted, then enter the quantity you're\ntaking.",

            "SFQ stands for Salesfloor Quantity, the\namount of product that is on the floor.\nSFC stands for Salesfloor Capacity, the\namount of product that will fit in a\nlocation.\nOH stands for On Hand, the amount of\nproduct we have in store.",
